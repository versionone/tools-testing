For release notes, we need a list of workitems that were included in the point release about to go out.
Bash script will output a file called point_release_commits.txt containing workitem IDs that were tagged on commits between the last point release and now. 
Run from the Core repo directory and output file will show up there as well.
When we drop support or add support for a new branch, update the file by either removing the dropped branch or adding the new one as appropriate.
