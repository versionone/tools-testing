For release notes, we need a list of workitems that were included in the point release about to go out.
Bash script will output a file called point_release_commits.txt containing workitem IDs that were tagged on commits between the last point release and now. 
Either drop this script into the core repo and run from their or add a line to cd to your core directory.

Run with space delimited branch names
ex: ./git_commits Release-17.0.12 Release-17.1.7
